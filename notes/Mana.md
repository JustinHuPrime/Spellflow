# Mana

Some spell pieces, in addition to data, consume mana

Mana flows as much as it can from sources to consumers; some spell pieces allow for more fine-grained manipulation of mana flow

## Sources

Mana jars and spell pieces can be manually filled at the cost of saturation (but not hunger) with a staff, at 1 mana/saturation point

Salt mana collector - produces 1/tick when placed on an amethyst block (max 1/tick) (Tier 2)

Water mana collector - produces 1/tick for each nearby flowing water block in a 3x3 cube centered on the collector (max 8/tick) (Tier 3)

Air mana collector - produces 1/tick for each clear run of 5 blocks in a 5x5 square centered on the collector (max 8/tick) (Tier 3)

Fire mana collector - produces 1/tick for each lava source block in a 3x3 cube centered on the collector (max 25/tick) (Tier 3)

Earth mana collector - produces 1/tick for each bedrock block in a 5x5 cube centered on the collector (max 40/tick) (Tier 3)

Life mana collector - produces 1/tick for each growing crop in a 5x5 cube centered on the collector (max 72/tick) (Tier 5)

Death mana collector - produces 100/tick when placed on a spawner (max 100/tick) (Tier 5)

Aether mana collector - produces 1000/tick, but consumes 1 star heart every 200 ticks/10 seconds (Tier 7)

Star hearts are created by applying an amount of mana specified by a large NP hard problem to a nether star (not consumed)
