Tier 1 (manual) requires deepslate, wood, amethyst

Tier 2 (automation) requires rough runic slates (T1 deepslate), orichalcum (T1 copper), crystal glass (T1 glass)

A rough runic slate is made by applying at least 20 units of mana to a block of cobbled deepslate

An orichalcum ingot is made by applying at least 20 units of mana to a copper ingot

A block of crystal glass is made by applying at least 20 units of mana to a block of glass

Tier 3 (variability) requires aurum (T2 gold), polished runic slates (T1+2 deepslate), purified amethyst (T2 amethyst)

A aurum ingot is made by applying at least 1 unit of mana over 20 ticks to a gold ingot

A polished runic slate is made by applying at least 1 unit of mana over 20 ticks to a rough runic slate

A purified amethyst is made by applying at least 1 unit of mana over 20 ticks to an amethyst shard

Tier 4 (sequential logic) requires fused quartz (T3 quartz), cut runic slates (T1+2+3 deepslate)

A piece of fused quartz is made by applying an amount of mana specified by an arithmetic expression unique to the piece, to a piece of quartz

A cut runic slate is made by applying an amount of mana specified by an arithmetic expression to a polished runic slate

Tier 5 (combinational logic) requires charged amethyst (T2+4 amethyst), chiseled runic slates (T1+2+3+4 deepslate)

A piece of charged amethyst is made by applying a sequence of mana values to a piece of purified amethyst

A chiseled runic slate is made by applying a sequence of mana values to a cut runic slate

Tier 6 (np completeness) requires recrystallized quartz (T3+5 quartz)

A piece of recrystallized quartz is made by applying a sequence of mana values each over some period of time to a piece of fused quartz

Tier 7 (endgame) requires etched diamond (T6 diamond)

A piece of etched diamond is made by applying an amount of mana specified by an NP-hard problem to a diamond
